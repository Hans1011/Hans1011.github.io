Hello! I am Chen Han, a student who strives to become better. I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Beihang University in 2022, and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Robotics at the National University of Singapore. I am very interested in developing efficient biosensors, and currently I am learning about circuit design and artificial intelligence programming.
In my spare time, I also enjoy reading and cycling
